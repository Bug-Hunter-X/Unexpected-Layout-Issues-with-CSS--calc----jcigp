The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering issues.  Specifically, the calculation within `calc()` might involve incompatible units (e.g., mixing pixels and percentages without proper conversion) or incorrect operator precedence.  Additionally, there might be syntax errors within the `calc()` expression itself, leading to the entire expression being ignored or interpreted incorrectly by the browser.
